# RL Classification

## TODO

- [x] Generalize environment
- [x] Generalize DQN
- [x] Add multiple agents to speed up the process
- [x] Speed up replay, by calling `fit` only once.
- [ ] Implement multiprocessing
- [ ] Add gin to set parameters
- [ ] Make a data class that will serve as input for the environment class. This way alows for more flexibility and works with large and small datasets. Should contain a `sample` function.
    - [ ] Data generator to handle large datasets
